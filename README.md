## Archivement 

* Scanning and Creating a map of indoor environment setup using 2d lidar
* Design a robust mobile robot base for further research
* Implement ROS2 and Nav2 for the mobile robot

## Further Development 

* Develop path planning and path following algorithm
* Apply a better version for odometry (Eg: GPS, QR code, Camera)
* Build better control system for robot
